# The Joys of Python.
## Oct 19th, 2024.
I'm not necessarily a rookie to programming, but I'm certainly not an expert. 

Python has always struck a nerve. I previously had understood the appeal of it, but never could enjoy it myself. It always seemed bulky and unwieldly. Maybe it was just my attraction to C++? Or perhaps, the looseness in typing required. Having now finished my first college class requiring Python, I can comfortably say that my opinion has shifted... There is something very utilitarian about this language that I can't fully describe. It's certainly not the fastest language, but it makes number and data crunching wicked quick, while also remaining simple enough to completely forgo boilerplate code. 

The moral of the story is that no matter what language is your preferred, maybe its worth trying something different... see what is out there, just maybe, you'll find something to add to your toolbox for a rainy day...
